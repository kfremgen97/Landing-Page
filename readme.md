# Landing Page

### Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project

**Purpose:** This project aims to give you real-world scenarios of manipulating the DOM. 
- Prepares you for appending dynamically added data to the DOM
- Shows you how javascript can improve the usability of an otherwise static site

Often times, we donâ€™t know how much content will be added to a page through a CMS or an API. 
To circumvent this problem, we can dynamically add the content to the page. 
This project creates a multi-section landing page. For the landing page, the navigation is build dynmically.
This is a great precursor to understanding the virtual DOM which you will experience when you begin working with JavaScript frameworks.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed is differentiated in the navigation. 
Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
